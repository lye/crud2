Package crud2 provides struct tag annotations for easy sql/database insert/update/delete.

crud2 allows you to annotate struct fields with corresponding SQL field names.
Types annotated as such can then be easily inserted/updated/scanned from
sql/database connections without incurring the usual programmer overhead.
crud2 does not handle schema generation; it simply reduces the amount of
boilerplate you'd need to write to interact with an existing schema.

crud2 works as a compile step. The included crudgen utility scans all
files in the working directory for crud-tagged structs and emits a
z_crudgen.go file that provides serializers/deserializers for them.

Consider this case:

	type Foo struct {
		Id int64 `crud:"foo_id"`
		Num int64 `crud:"foo_num"`
		Str string `crud:"foo_str"`
		Time time.Time `crud:"foo_time"`
		UnixTime time.Time `crud:"foo_unix_time,unix"`
	}

And this existing schema:

	CREATE TABLE foo
		( foo_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
		, foo_num INTEGER NOT NULL
		, foo_str VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL
		, foo_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
		, foo_unix_time INTEGER NOT NULL
		);

With vanilla database/sql, to extract values from an *sql.Rows you have to do a
considerable amount of hoop-jumping:

	// old code
	rows, _ := db.Query("SELECT foo_id, foo_num, foo_str, foo_time, foo_unix_time FROM foos")
	defer rows.Close()

	foos := []Foos{}
	for rows.Next() {
		var foo Foo
		rows.Scan(&foo.Id, &foo.Num, &foo.Str, &foo.Time, &foo.UnixTime)
		foos = append(foos, foo)
	}

With a significant number of columns to extract one-by-one (or extracting
multiple objects from, e.g., a complex query with lots of JOINs) the amount of
noisy code increases significantly. crud provides the following alternative:

	// new code
	rows, _ := db.Query("SELECT * FROM foos")
	foos := []Foos{}
	crud.ScanAll(rows, &foos)

Each struct field that has a corresponding SQL row must be tagged with the SQL 
row name. For time types, the "unix" tag can be used to trigger marshalling between
the Go time.Time type and a numeric SQL field. 

Any pointer fields with a corresponding sql.Null* type are marshalled to/from 
the Null type for proper interaction with database/sql.
